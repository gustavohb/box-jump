## About

This is my first game created in Unity. Made just for fun.

In this game the player controls a box that jumps to avoid obstacles.

Touch the screen or press space to let box jump over intactly. If you failed, you can always retry to challenge present level!

You can play the game by downloading in the release page the build corresponding to your OS (It's available [Windows](https://github.com/gustavohb/box-jump/releases/download/0.1/Box.Jump.0.1.Windows.zip), [Android](https://github.com/gustavohb/box-jump/releases/download/0.1/Box.Jump.0.1.Android.apk), and [MacOS](https://github.com/gustavohb/box-jump/releases/download/0.1/Box.Jump.0.1.MacOS.zip)) or just go [here](https://gustavohb.github.io/box-jump/) to directly play it in your browser.

I didn't come up with the idea of this game. The original game concept was created by [Thomas Palef](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/box-jump/). I simply made a version in Unity of his game with some slightly different levels.

*Used Unity Version: 2019.3*
