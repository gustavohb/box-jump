## About

This is my first game created in Unity. Made just for fun.

In this game the player controls a box that jumps to avoid obstacles.

Touch the screen or press space to let box jump over intactly. If you failed, you can always retry to challenge present level!

I didn't come up with the idea of this game. The original game concept was created by [Thomas Palef](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/box-jump/). I simply made a version in Unity of his game with some slightly different levels.

*Used Unity Version: 2019.4.18f1*
